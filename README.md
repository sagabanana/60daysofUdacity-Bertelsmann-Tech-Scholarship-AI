# 60daysofUdacity-Bertelsmann-Tech-Scholarship-AI
code/work through the AI in Business, Foundations course content and related to this scholarship for at least 30 mins every day

## 12/10/2020
Day 1: made the pledge to study the coursework for at least 30 mins a day for the next 60 days.
I completed Part 3. Lesson 1: Data Fit and Annotation; 1-10 


## 12/11/2020
Day 2: 1) continued data fit and annotation.  2) Finally, watched The Social Dilemma.  The most astute, simple, true statement that I heard on the subject to date:

"Algorithms is an opinion embedded in code. It's really different from what you think most people think of algorithms. They think algorithms are objective and true and scientific. That's a marketing trick. It's also a marketing trick to intimidate you with algorithms, to make you trust and fear algorithms because you trust and fear mathematics."

by Cathy O'Neil, Data Scientist who wrote "Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy."

I found her TedTalk video for reference.  There she says: "I have two more messages, one for the data scientists out there. Data scientists: we should not be the arbiters of truth. We should be translators of ethical discussions that happen in larger society.

And the rest of you, the non-data scientists: this is not a math test. This is a political fight. We need to demand accountability for our algorithmic overlords."  https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare

3) Learned of Qwant.com which claims that this search engine doesn't collect data from users.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwant  "Qwant is a French web search engine, launched in July 2013 and operated from Paris. It is one of the few EU-based search engines with its own indexing engine. It claims that it does not employ user tracking or personalize search results in order to avoid trapping users in a filter bubble. The search engine is available in 26 languages."

Day 11: started 4 Lesson 2 Optional Project:  Build a Model 

Read and shared a read about Ubuntu.  "Ubuntu, how can one of be happy if all the other ones are sad?'

Ubuntu is more commonly interpreted as ‘I am because we are’. It means that we are all a sum total not just of our own experiences but because we are social creatures, we are a collective summary of our own as well as the shared experiences of our society.

Desmond Tutu beautifully said “A person is a person through other persons. None of us comes into the world fully formed. We would not know how to think, or walk, or speak, or behave as human beings unless we learned it from other human beings. We need other human beings in order to be human”.

Day 12: 4 Lesson 2 optional project:  Build a Model
Launched #sg_strictly_projects study group
Read and shared 2 articles:  1) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/intern-builds-billion-dollar-company-inspired-by-mom-s-comment
'Tsuruoka was studying information technology in college when he started his internship at the crowdfunding startup. He recalls being fascinated by the success of companies like PayPal Holdings Inc., though he hadn’t imagined setting up a business himself.
Then, when his mom said she wanted her own online store, the idea sprang from that. He began working on the business and later quit college.
“I started Base as a hobby,” he said. “But it was well-received by everyone, so I ended up setting up a company.”'
