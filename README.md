# 60daysofUdacity-Bertelsmann-Tech-Scholarship-AI
code/work through the AI in Business, Foundations course content and related to this scholarship for at least 30 mins every day

## 12/10/2020
Day 1: made the pledge to study the coursework for at least 30 mins a day for the next 60 days.
I completed Part 3. Lesson 1: Data Fit and Annotation; 1-10 


## 12/11/2020
Day 2: 1) continued data fit and annotation.  2) Finally, watched The Social Dilemma.  The most astute, simple, true statement that I heard on the subject to date:

"Algorithms is an opinion embedded in code. It's really different from what you think most people think of algorithms. They think algorithms are objective and true and scientific. That's a marketing trick. It's also a marketing trick to intimidate you with algorithms, to make you trust and fear algorithms because you trust and fear mathematics."

by Cathy O'Neil, Data Scientist who wrote "Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy."

I found her TedTalk video for reference.  There she says: "I have two more messages, one for the data scientists out there. Data scientists: we should not be the arbiters of truth. We should be translators of ethical discussions that happen in larger society.

And the rest of you, the non-data scientists: this is not a math test. This is a political fight. We need to demand accountability for our algorithmic overlords."  https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare

3) Learned of Qwant.com which claims that this search engine doesn't collect data from users.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwant  "Qwant is a French web search engine, launched in July 2013 and operated from Paris. It is one of the few EU-based search engines with its own indexing engine. It claims that it does not employ user tracking or personalize search results in order to avoid trapping users in a filter bubble. The search engine is available in 26 languages."

“Success is somebody else’s failure.”

“Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings”

“What goes too long unchanged destroys itself.”

## 12/20/2020
Day 11: started 4 Lesson 2 Optional Project:  Build a Model 

Read and shared a read about Ubuntu.  "Ubuntu, how can one of be happy if all the other ones are sad?'

Ubuntu is more commonly interpreted as ‘I am because we are’. It means that we are all a sum total not just of our own experiences but because we are social creatures, we are a collective summary of our own as well as the shared experiences of our society.

Desmond Tutu beautifully said “A person is a person through other persons. None of us comes into the world fully formed. We would not know how to think, or walk, or speak, or behave as human beings unless we learned it from other human beings. We need other human beings in order to be human”.

Day 12: 4 Lesson 2 optional project:  Build a Model
Launched #sg_strictly_projects study group
Read and shared 2 articles:  1) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/intern-builds-billion-dollar-company-inspired-by-mom-s-comment
'Tsuruoka was studying information technology in college when he started his internship at the crowdfunding startup. He recalls being fascinated by the success of companies like PayPal Holdings Inc., though he hadn’t imagined setting up a business himself.
Then, when his mom said she wanted her own online store, the idea sprang from that. He began working on the business and later quit college.
“I started Base as a hobby,” he said. “But it was well-received by everyone, so I ended up setting up a company.”'

Day 13:  Continued with the 2nd optional project:  Build a model
Read, shared and discussed AI: 
1) 'On Tuesday, December 15, the Air Force successfully flew an AI copilot on a U-2 spy plane in California: the first time AI has controlled a U.S. military system.'
The U.S. Air Force flew an artificial intelligence (AI) copilot on a U-2 spy plane in California.
The flight marked the first time in the history of the Department of Defense that an AI took flight aboard a military aircraft.
The AI algorithm, developed by Air Combat Command’s U-2 Federal Laboratory, trained the AI to execute specific in-flight tasks that would otherwise be done by the pilot.

Thought for the day.  The words of Sam Altman, the former president of Y Combinator and now the CEO of OpenAI from 'How to be Successful'

3. Learn to think independently

Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.

Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.

“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.

One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.

'2. Have almost too much self-belief

Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.

Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.

If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”

Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  

Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.

Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.

This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.'

Day 20: 
I read one of the most read 2020 MIT Technology Review and thought about how we can stop and relieve 
the crippling damage that puts and keeps already disadvantaged people in the continuous disadvantaged loop.  
I have been alerted of this news and nothing substantial has been done to correct this flawed system. 
I think not so much that people don't care but complexity and its size of wrong is monumental to correct it all together.
We are sort of looking at each other who is going to fix the error first.  What I can do at this moment is keep talking about 
it until it gets fixed.

Lastly, I am sharing the words of Henry David Thoreau and a photo of the moon from last night

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, 
to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, 
and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, 
living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. 
I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and 
Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, 
to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.

Henry David Thoreau

## 12/30/2020
Day 21:  Read 'The post-app era: The next stage of education technology'

Key highlight:  "So far, the growth of education technology has been limited, in part, because of missing #edtech leadership at the school, district, and state level. The expertise, experience, and vision is absent–which leads to more purchasing and policies than inspiration and design."

"Education is suffering not just from a lack of edtech leadership, but a lack of frameworks and systems that ‘accept’ technology. The next stage of #edtech–and apps can be a big part of this–has to be smarter than the ‘solutions’ we’re currently settling for, or they’re not solutions at all."
https://www.teachthought.com/technology/stages-of-education-technology/

Read and shared an article on how developing AI models is adding up to a large carbon footprint and its grand cost that only a few select labs can afford to do it, and these a few will eventually decide the future of AI:  "All of this means that developing advanced AI models is adding up to a large carbon footprint. Unless we switch to 100% renewable energy sources, AI progress may stand at odds with the goals of cutting greenhouse emissions and slowing down climate change. The financial cost of development is also becoming so high that only a few select labs can afford to do it, and they will be the ones to set the agenda for what kinds of AI models get developed."

"Looking forward, the AI community should invest more in developing energy-efficient training schemes. Otherwise, it risks having AI become dominated by a select few who can afford to set the agenda, including what kinds of models are developed, what kinds of data are used to train them and what the models are used for."

Day 22:  The last day of 2020, continuing with AI in Business. This is not directly related to AI, but a story of opportunity, decision making, dedication, preparedness, product/product management, taking risks, visionary; Dr. Sahin and follow-ups; his wife Dr. Türeci partnership and entrepreneurship. How this (scientist) couple from Turkey immigrated to Germany taking a chance, opportunity to make a better life for themselves and others and developed the record-setting Covid vaccine in just a few hours over a single day.  Normally it takes about 5 to 15 years.  They have been working on a vaccine to cure cancer for last 20 years and try the same idea to develop the Covid vaccine partnership with Pfizer.   It's always interesting to see how one thing leads to another, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."  Here is the WSJ interview's audio recording with the creator of the record-setting Covid vaccine, Dr. Sahin. https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-couples-quest-to-cure-cancer-led-to-the-wests-first-covid-19-vaccine-11606905001

Created more teams and added #sg_strictly_projects pair project teams in a doc and added the link of that doc to the Channel Topic to preserve the info for a longer time - thanks @Palak.Udacity's suggestion.
Went over Lesson 2: Intro to AI and ML in Business 

I listened to a sage, a Zen monk talk at Google.  Wrote and shared this gem talk to multiple channels, "Examine your life. Examine your motivation.  Take some time to listen to his talk."

Working on #sg_strictly_projects team building and meetings
Just read a research article on How Autism and Invention Are Connected; autism or extreme hyper-systemizing - some of the genes associated with hyper-systemizing are the same genes that code for autism.

One study called, "Silicon Valley study" has found higher number of autism or hyper-systemizing - more than twice as high in the Silicon Valley of Netherlands compared with 2 other Dutch cities.  Which gives us solid insights self explains the unethical, insensitive, inhumane phenomenas we've been witnessing and hearing, for one, the Bay area's homeless crisis is beyond out of control - which in desperate needs of empathy, diversity and inclusion, arts and humanity in the tech industry.

"The more your brain is tuned to seek such patterns, the less you can engage the brain's parallel circuit for empathy, another important and uniquely human capacity"
"Autistic people were far more likely to be on the extreme hyper-systemizing end. People working in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) fields—bastions of invention—had a higher number of autistic traits than those not working in STEM."
