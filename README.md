# 60daysofUdacity-Bertelsmann-Tech-Scholarship-AI
code/work through the AI in Business, Foundations course content and related to this scholarship for at least 30 mins every day

## 12/10/2020
Day 1 - made the pledge to study the coursework for at least 30 mins a day for the next 60 days.
I completed Part 3. Lesson 1: Data Fit and Annotation; 1-10

Day 2 - 1) continued data fit and annotation.  2) Finally, watched The Social Dilemma.  The most astute, simple, true statement that I heard on the subject to date:

"Algorithms is an opinion embedded in code. It's really different from what you think most people think of algorithms. They think algorithms are objective and true and scientific. That's a marketing trick. It's also a marketing trick to intimidate you with algorithms, to make you trust and fear algorithms because you trust and fear mathematics."

by Cathy O'Neil, Data Scientist who wrote "Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy."

I found her TedTalk video for reference.  There she says: "I have two more messages, one for the data scientists out there. Data scientists: we should not be the arbiters of truth. We should be translators of ethical discussions that happen in larger society.

And the rest of you, the non-data scientists: this is not a math test. This is a political fight. We need to demand accountability for our algorithmic overlords."  https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare

3) Learned of Qwant.com which claims that this search engine doesn't collect data from users.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwant  "Qwant is a French web search engine, launched in July 2013 and operated from Paris. It is one of the few EU-based search engines with its own indexing engine. It claims that it does not employ user tracking or personalize search results in order to avoid trapping users in a filter bubble. The search engine is available in 26 languages."

Sharing Ursula K Le Guin's words:

“Success is somebody else’s failure.”

“Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings”

“What goes too long unchanged destroys itself.”
